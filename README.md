# Churn_Analysis_with_Power_BI
In this project, we'll explore a dataset from Databel, a telecom company, to examine their churn rates. Our goal isn't just to identify the churn rate; it's also to understand why customers are leaving and find ways to minimize churn. To achieve this, we'll develop metrics and calculated variables and design visually engaging report pages.
